Description: 
                PyMEL makes python scripting with Maya work the way it should. Maya's command module is a direct translation
                of mel commands into python commands. The result is a very awkward and unpythonic syntax which does not take
                advantage of python's strengths -- particulary, a flexible, object-oriented design. PyMEL builds on the cmds
                module by organizing many of its commands into a class hierarchy, and by customizing them to operate in a more
                succinct and intuitive way.
